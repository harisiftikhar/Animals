        <h2>Inrertebrates</h2>
    </i>
    <p>The first animals to evolve, as far back as a billion years ago, invertebrates are characterized by their lack of
        backbones and internal skeletons, as well as their relatively simple anatomy and behavior, at least as compared
        to most vertebrates. Today, invertebrates
        account for a whopping 97 percent of all animal species; this widely varied group includes insects, worms,
        arthropods, sponges, mollusks, octopuses, and countless other families. </p>

        <h2>Fish</h2>
    </i>
    <p>The first true vertebrates on earth, fish evolved from invertebrate ancestors about 500 million years ago, and
        have dominated the world's oceans, lakes, and rivers ever since. There are three main types of fish:
        bony fish (which includes such familiar species as tuna and salmon); cartilaginous fish (which includes sharks,
        rays, and skates); and jawless fish (a small family made up entirely of hagfish and lampreys). Fish breathe
        using gills and are equipped with "lateral lines" that detect water currents and even electricity. </p>

        <h2>Amphibians</h2>
    </i>
    <p>When the first amphibians evolved from their tetrapod ancestors, 400 million years ago, they quickly became the
        dominant vertebrates on earth. However, their reign wasn't destined to last;
        the frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians that make up this group have long since been out-competed by
        reptiles, birds, and mammals. Amphibians are characterized by their semi-aquatic lifestyles
        (they have to stay near bodies of water, both to maintain the moisture of their skin and to lay their eggs), and
        today they are among the most endangered animals on earth. </p>

        <li>Salamanders</li>

        <h2>Reptiles</h2>
    </i>
    <p>Reptiles, like amphibians, make up a fairly small proportion of terrestrial animalsâ€”but in the form of dinosaurs,
        they ruled the earth for over 150 million years. There are four basic types of reptiles: crocodiles and
        alligators, turtles and tortoises, snakes, and lizards. Reptiles are characterized by their cold-blooded
        metabolismsâ€”they fuel themselves up by exposure to the sunâ€”their scaly skin, and their leathery eggs, which,
        unlike amphibians, they can lay some distance away from bodies of water. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crocodile</li>
        <li>Turtles</li>
        <li>Snakes</li>
    </ul>

    <i>
        <h2>Birds</h2>
    </i>
    <p>Birds evolved from dinosaursâ€”not once, but probably multiple timesâ€”during the Mesozoic Era, and today they are by
        far the most prolific flying vertebrates, numbering about 10,000 species spread across 30 separate orders. Birds
        are characterized by their coats of feathers, their warm-blooded metabolisms, their memorable songs (at least in
        certain species), and their ability to adapt to a wide range of habitatsâ€”witness the ostriches of the Australian
        plains and the penguins of the Antarctic coastline.</p>

        <h2>Mammals</h2>
    </i>
    <p>It's natural for people to consider mammals the pinnacle of evolution--after all, humans are mammals, and so were
        our ancestors. (In fact, mammals are among the least diverse animal groupsâ€”there are only about 5,000 species
        overall!) Mammals are characterized by their hair or fur (which all species possess during some stage of their
        life cycles), the milk with which they suckle their young, and their warm-blooded metabolisms, which, as with
        birds, allows them to inhabit a wide range of habitats, ranging from deserts to oceans to arctic tundra. </p>
